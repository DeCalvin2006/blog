<h1 align="center">paper</h1>

<p align="center">üé® paper is a concise hexo theme with no redundant visual elements and functions. Its design style is inspired by paper readings such as üì∞ <strong>newspaper</strong>. And the theme implements the current (2019) popular üåó<strong>Dark Mode</strong> in a üí°<strong>extremely clever</strong> way, which can be enabled with one click. </p>
